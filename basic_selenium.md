# üß™ Basic Selenium Concepts

## ‚úÖ What is Selenium?

**Selenium** is a **free and open-source tool** used to **automate web browsers**.
It works with browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.

## üß© Components of Selenium

Selenium has **3 main components**:

### 1. Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- Browser extension (Chrome, Firefox)
- Allows **Record and Playback** (like video recorder)
- No coding required
- Suitable for **absolute beginners**
- Limited functionality

### Use Case:
- Quick prototyping of tests
- Demo purposes
- Learning automation basics

### Limitations:
- Not suitable for complex tests
- Doesn‚Äôt support advanced browser interactions
- Limited support for dynamic elements

**Example:** Open Chrome ‚Üí Click record ‚Üí Click login button ‚Üí Stop ‚Üí Play again ‚Üí Selenium repeats the actions.

### 2. Selenium WebDriver ‚≠êÔ∏è (Most important)
- Core component of Selenium
- Used to **write code** to automate browsers
- Supports languages: **Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, Ruby**
- Controls browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.
- Allows interaction with elements: buttons, forms, dropdowns, etc.

### Advantages:
- Powerful and flexible
- Supports complex automation scenarios
- Integrates with test frameworks like TestNG, JUnit
- Supports parallel execution (when used with Selenium Grid)

### Use Case:
- Real-world, robust test automation suites
- Complex scenarios involving dynamic elements
- Continuous Integration pipelines

> Example: Login automation ‚Üí `driver.findElement(By.id("username")).sendKeys("admin");`

---

### 3. Selenium Grid
- Selenium Grid is used for running tests on multiple machines and browsers in parallel.
- Used for **parallel execution** (multiple browsers/machines)
- Supports **distributed testing**
- Very useful for **cross-browser testing**

### Benefits:
- Run tests faster (parallel execution)
- Cross-browser and cross-platform testing
- Supports large test suites

### Setup:
- Install and configure Selenium Grid Hub and Nodes.
- Register Nodes to Hub.
- Configure tests to run on Grid.

### Use Case:
- Big projects with multiple test cases.
- Teams needing faster feedback by running tests in parallel.
- Testing on cloud platforms (BrowserStack, Sauce Labs use Grid concepts).

**Use Case:** You have 100 test cases ‚Üí Run 25 each on 4 different machines at the same time.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Advantages of Selenium

‚úÖ Free and Open Source  
‚úÖ Works with all major browsers  
‚úÖ Supports many programming languages  
‚úÖ Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)  
‚úÖ Integration with tools: Maven, TestNG, Jenkins, etc.

---

## ‚ùå Limitations of Selenium

‚ùå Only supports **Web Applications** (no desktop/mobile apps)  
‚ùå No built-in report generation  
‚ùå Can‚Äôt handle Captchas, barcodes, 2FA directly  
‚ùå Needs programming knowledge  
‚ùå Doesn‚Äôt support image comparison

## Why do we need Selenium?

Manual testing lo problems enti?

- Time-consuming: Prati sari manual ga repeat cheyyali testing steps.
- Error prone: Manually mistakes jaragachu.
- Not scalable: Large applications lo chala test cases unte, manual testing chala kastam.
- No consistency: Different testers ki results vary avvachu.

## What does Selenium do?

Selenium automates browser actions like:

Open browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

- Navigate to URLs
- Click buttons, links
- Enter text in forms
- Handle popups, alerts
- Select dropdowns, radio buttons
- Scroll pages
- Take screenshots

## is Selenium is a Programming Language

No!
Selenium is a tool/library. It needs to be controlled using programming languages like:
Java
Python
C#
JavaScript
Ruby

So, you write test scripts in your favorite language using Selenium APIs.

## What can you automate with Selenium?

- Functional testing of websites
- Regression testing (repeating old tests)
- Cross-browser testing
- Testing complex user interactions
- Integration with build tools and CI/CD

## What Selenium does not do?

- Automate desktop apps (not for Windows apps)
- Mobile apps automation (use Appium for that)
- Handle Captchas and some security features
- API testing
